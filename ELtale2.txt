Buggy is an insect.
He is living on a tree.
He likes food.
He went to a garden.
The garden was beautiful.
The grass was green.
The sky was blue.
There were no clouds.
The day was good.
He looked for food.
He saw an apple.
He flew to the apple.
I got him with a bottle.
I took him to my room.
I gave him grass.
He did not like it.
I gave him flower.
He did not like it.
I gave him apple.
He liked it.
Yesterday he was dead.
I was sad.
I went out.
I saw insects.
They were free.
They were happy.
