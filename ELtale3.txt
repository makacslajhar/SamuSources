Red is a bird.
He is red.
He lives in our garden.
He likes insects.
He likes seeds.
He likes jumping.
He likes flying.
I see him from my window every day.
I want to catch him.
Mom told me not to.
She said Red likes freedom.
I did not listen to her.
I caught Red today.
He was frightened.
Now I understand what mother said.
I realized that Red belongs to nature.
He does not like humans.
He just want to fly around.
He just want to eat.
He just want to live his own life.
He just want to live free.
