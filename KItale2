Once upon a time there was a miner.
He found a large cave.
There was a lot of gold inside.
He didn't want anyone to know about the place.
So he didn't tell anyone about it.
The miner worked in the cave day and night all alone.
GH piled up a great amount of gold.
He could have got help with the mining.
He didn't want to share the gold with anyone.
He didn't want help even when a big block of gold fell on his leg.
He barly made it out alive.
When he needed money he planed to sell a piece of gold.
He thought people will get curious how he got it.
So he didn't sell it.
He just kept on digging and collecting the rest of the gold.
He finished mining the gold.
He just sat there and gazed upon the gold.
One day while he was sleeping a thief sneaked into his cave.
The thief stole all the gold he had.
He was really upset.
He worked hard to get all that gold.
He could have sold it until he had the chance.
He could have lived a happy life with a big fortune.
He was too greedy to sell the gold.
The moral of the story is that, greed could lead to really bad luck.
